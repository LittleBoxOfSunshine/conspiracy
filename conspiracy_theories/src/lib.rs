//! This is the collection of traits re-exported by the configuration crate [`conspiracy`](https://crates.io/crates/conspiracy).
//! Conspiracy is a very opinionated crate, but each component is designed to be used in isolation
//! or replaced if desired. This provides a minimal dependency for alternate implementations.
